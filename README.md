# CPS510
This repository contains code for CPS 510 Database Systems at Ryerson University.
My course project was to create an application that kept track of Inventory of a fictional Movie and Music Store.
This was first completed using a bash script that sent CRUD commands to the sqlplus program which is used to interface with the Oracle 11g database. Then a GUI was built using Oracle's 11g Driver for Java. The UI folder contains the GUI portion of this project.
